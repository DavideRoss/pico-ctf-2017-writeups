# Bash Loop
## Level 1 - binary exploitation - 40 points

### Description
> We found a program that is hiding a flag but requires you to guess the number it is thinking of. Chances are Linux has an easy way to try all the numbers... Go to /problems/77ad2ec283d51f7b1ddc449ffe109e0b and try it out!

### Hints
> * Either use SSH or use the Web Shell to get onto the shell server and navigate to the correct directory. Then do a quick Google search on 'bash loops'. You may need to use grep to filter out the responses as well!

### Solution

Connect with `ssh` then `cd` into `/problems/77ad2ec283d51f7b1ddc449ffe109e0b`. Executing `bashloop` prints this:

```
$ ./bashloop
What number am I thinking of? It is between 0 and 4096
```

The executable take as argument your guess, if it's matched to the number hardcoded will print the flag:

```
$ ./bashloop 1000
Nope. Pick another number between 0 and 4096
```

We can cycle all numbers from 0 to 4096 with a `for` loop, calling the program and `grep`ping the results:

```sh
$ for i in {0..4096}; do ./bashloop $i; done | grep flag
Yay! That's the number! Here be the flag: 9963698b982d491536dbb9cec73a417e
```

### Flag

# My First SQL
## level 2 - web exploitation - 50 points

### Description
> I really need access to [website](http://shell2017.picoctf.com:58553/), but I forgot my password and there is no reset. Can you help?

### Hints
> * Have you heard about SQL injection?

### Solution

Clearly, as the title says, we have to use SQL injection. We can guess that username can be `admin` or `administrator` and we can get the structure of the query triggering an error sending a single quote as username. This will be the error message:

```sql
select * from users where user = ''' and pass = '';
```

So the executable simply concatenate strings to query without an validation. With previous supposition we can send `admin` as username and `' or 1 = 1 --` as password and this query will be executed:

```sql
select * from users where user = 'admin' and pass = '' or 1 = 1 --';
```

Bypanssing completly password check. A message with the flag will notice us of successful injection.

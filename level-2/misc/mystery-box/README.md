# Mystery Box
## level 2 - misc - 60 points

### Description
> You've found a mystery machine with a sticky [note](./data/note.txt) attached to it! Oh, there's also this [picture](./data/MysteryBox.png) of the machine you found.

### Hints
> * It really gets your gears Turing.
> * I hear there's something Naval about it.

### Solution

From the picture attached the can evince that we are talking about the [Enigma machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine), a German electro-mechanical cipher used during WWII. We have the encrypted text and its configuration in the note, just use an emulator to get the plain text. I used [this](http://enigma.louisedade.co.uk/enigma.html).
